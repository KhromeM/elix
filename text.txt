The Stream module contains a few more functions that produce an infinite stream, such as Stream.unfold/2 or Stream.resource/3. Take a look at the official documentation for details.

Practicing
This style of coding takes some getting used to. Youâ€™ll use the techniques presented here throughout the book, but you should try to write a couple such iterations yourself. Here are some exercise ideas that may help you get into the swing of things.

Using large_lines!/1 as a model, write the following functions:

A lines_lengths!/1 that takes a file path and returns a list of numbers, with each number representing the length of the corresponding line from the file.
A longest_line_length!/1 that returns the length of the longest line in a file.
A longest_line!/1 that returns the contents of the longest line in a file.
A words_per_line!/1 that returns a list of numbers, with each number representing the word count in a file. Hint: to get the word count of a line, use length(String.split(line)).
Solutions are provided in the enum_streams_practice.ex file, but I strongly suggest that you spend some time trying to crack these problems yourself.
